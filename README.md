# Dead-Sun-1.21
# Mechanics

1. For the first 4 days(Ideally, add the ability to adjust the time (speed it up or slow it down).) nothing happens.
2. From day 5 to day 10, the "temperature" of the Earth's surface increases. Animals, trees, and the player begin to catch fire in the sunlight. Water and ice evaporate under the sun, and stone or cobblestone starts turning into lava(Over time and with a certain chance.). Meanwhile, the fire that was lit stops being extinguished(Preferably, this happens only during the daytime in the sun.).
3. From day 11 to infinity, everything begins to freeze. Lava solidifies as if water were poured over it, and the fire goes out. The player and entities stop burning in the sun. It is constantly snowing or foggy.
